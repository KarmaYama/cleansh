//! This file defines the command-line interface (CLI) for the cleansh application,
//! including all available commands and their arguments.
//! It uses the `clap` library to parse command-line arguments and subcommands.
//! The CLI structure is designed to be extensible, allowing for future commands and options.
//! It also includes global flags that apply across commands, such as debug logging and theme customization.
//! The main command is `cleansh`, with subcommands like `sanitize`, `scan`, and `uninstall`.
//! This file is the entry point for the CLI, and it integrates with the `cleansh`
//! application logic to execute the appropriate commands based on user input.
//!
//! The CLI is designed to be user-friendly, with clear help messages and options for customization.
