# CleanSH License Notes

This document provides detailed information regarding the licensing of CleanSH, particularly concerning the transition to the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0, which became effective with `v0.1.5`.

## License Summary
* **Versions < v0.1.5:** Remain under the permissive **MIT License**. These versions are not actively maintained and do not receive security patches or new features.
* **Versions >= v0.1.5:** Are licensed under the **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0**. This license permits noncommercial use and an evaluation period for commercial entities, as detailed below.

## Commercial Use Defined
"Commercial Use" includes, but is not limited to:
* Any use by for-profit entities or organizations.
* Use in a production environment for a commercial product or service.
* Use that directly or indirectly contributes to commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
* Use by government agencies, unless covered by a separate agreement.

## CleanSH v0.1.5 and Later: Evaluation Period for Commercial Use
We understand that commercial entities need to test and evaluate software. Therefore, all versions of CleanSH from `v0.1.5` up to `v0.x.x` may be used by commercial entities for evaluation and trial purposes. This period is intended to allow for a comprehensive assessment of CleanSH's capabilities and suitability for commercial needs. No immediate license is required for this evaluation phase.

## Long-Term Plan: CleanSH v1.0.0 and Beyond
With the release of CleanSH version 1.0.0 (expected Q4 2025 or Q1 2026), all commercial use and pro features will strictly require a valid commercial license key. We understand that commercial use is a broad term. Any feature not tagged as a pro feature does not fall under commercial use umbrella regradless of how its used. This effectively means its a free tier feature

* **Noncommercial Use:** The core CleanSH CLI will remain available for noncommercial use under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0.
* **Commercial Use:** Version `1.0.0` and all subsequent versions will incorporate an in-app license key validation mechanism. Commercial entities will be required to purchase a license key to continue using these versions.
* **All features released in versions < v1.0.0 (e.g., 0.x.x)** remain available for use under their respective licenses without an in-app validation key.

## Policy Enforcement
Any commercial use of CleanSH from version 1.0.0 onwards without a valid license key is a violation of the Commercial Use Policy. This policy is in place to ensure the project's sustainability and continued development for all users. After version 1.0.0 is released we wont be supporting 0.x.x versions of CleanSH
