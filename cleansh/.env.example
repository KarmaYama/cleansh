# .env.example- rename to .env and put in root

# LOG_LEVEL: Controls the verbosity of logs.
# Options: trace, debug, info, warn, error
# Default in logger.rs is 'info' if not set here or by RUST_LOG env var.
LOG_LEVEL=info

# CLIPBOARD_ENABLED: Whether clipboard output is enabled by default.
# Users can override this with the --clipboard flag.
# Options: true, false
CLIPBOARD_ENABLED=true

# DEFAULT_CONFIG: Path to the default rules file.
# This should point to the embedded default_rules.yaml, though usually
# the application directly accesses the embedded data. This variable is
# more for documentation or if you ever intend to load a *different*
# default at runtime (not recommended for core behavior for security).
# For now, it's mostly illustrative, as the default rules are embedded.
# The value here is not directly used for loading the *embedded* rules.
DEFAULT_CONFIG=./config/default_rules.yaml
