## Feature Request: `[Concise Feature Title]`

This template helps us understand your needs and collaborate effectively on new features for `cleansh`. Please fill out the sections below with as much detail as possible.

### **1. Problem Description**

Please describe the challenge or frustration you encounter that this feature would address.
* **What specific issue are you facing?** (e.g., "I'm unable to redact X type of data efficiently," or "The current output format doesn't integrate well with Y system.")
* **How does this problem impact your workflow or use of `cleansh`?** (e.g., "It requires manual post-processing," or "It exposes sensitive information in certain scenarios.")

---

### **2. Desired Solution**

Clearly describe the functionality you'd like to see implemented.
* **What should the new feature do?** (e.g., "Add a new redaction category for Z," or "Provide an option to export diffs in JSON format.")
* **How would it work from a user's perspective?** (e.g., "A new command-line flag `--my-new-feature` should be available," or "It should automatically detect and redact X when piping input.")
* **What benefits would this solution provide?** (e.g., "It would save X minutes per day," or "It would enhance security compliance for Y data.")

### **4. Additional Context**

Please provide any extra information that might be helpful.
* **Are there any specific use cases or scenarios that highlight the need for this feature?**
* **Do you have examples of input/output, or code snippets (e.g., sample logs, mock data, or a custom YAML rule) that illustrate the problem or desired solution?**
