## 1. Overview

`cleansh` is a powerful and reliable command‑line utility designed to help you quickly and securely redact sensitive information from your terminal output. 
Whether you're debugging, collaborating, or sharing logs, `cleansh` ensures that confidential data like IP addresses, email addresses, and access tokens never leave your local environment unmasked. Piped directly from `stdin` or loaded from files, `cleansh` provides a robust, pre‑configured solution for data sanitization, with flexible options for custom rules and output formats.

**Sanitize your terminal output. One tool. One purpose.**

---

## 3. Core Capabilities – Current Version (**v0.1.5**)

This release represents a significant leap forward in `cleansh`'s accuracy, security, and testability. Based on our rigorously passing test suite, `cleansh` accurately masks:

### 3.1. Enhanced Redaction Categories:

`cleansh` offers broad and precise detection across a wide range of sensitive data types, complemented by robust programmatic validation for key PII:

* **Emails:** Common email formats (e.g., `user@example.com`). 
* **IP Addresses:** Both **IPv4** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) and **IPv6** addresses (full uncompressed form, e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`). 
* **Tokens & Secrets:**   * **JWTs**   * **GitHub PATs** (`ghp_…`) 
  * **GitHub fine‑grained PATs** (`github_pat_…`, 72 characters) 
  * **Stripe keys** (`sk_live_…`, `sk_test_…`, `rk_live_…`) 
  * **AWS Access/Secret Keys**   * **GCP API Keys**   * **Google OAuth tokens** (`ya29.…`, 20–120 characters) 
  * **SSH private keys**   * **Generic Hex Secrets** (32 and 64 characters) 
  * **Generic Tokens** * **Personal Identifiable Information (PII):**   * **Credit Card Numbers**   * **US Social Security Numbers (SSN)** (with programmatic validation against invalid patterns like `000-XX-XXXX`, `666-XX-XXXX`, or `9XX-XX-XXXX`). 
  * **UK National Insurance Numbers (NINO)** (with programmatic validation against invalid prefixes and structural rules). 
  * **South African ID Numbers** * **Paths & URLs:**   * **Linux/macOS Absolute Paths** (`/home/user/...` → `~/home/user/...`). 
  * **Windows Absolute Paths** (`C:\Users\…`, `\\Server\Share\…`). 
  * **Slack Webhook URLs** (`https://hooks.slack.com/services/T...`) 
* **Authentication Headers:**   * **HTTP Basic Auth Headers** (`Authorization: Basic ...`)

### 3.2. Advanced Features (with flags):

`cleansh` provides command‑line flags to customize its behavior, all thoroughly tested:

* **Copy to Clipboard (`-c` / `--clipboard`):** Instantly copy sanitized output. 
* **Diff View (`-d` / `--diff`):** Show a colored, line‑by‑line diff of redactions. 
* **Custom Config (`--config <path>`):** Load and merge your YAML redaction rules with built-in defaults. 
* **Output File (`-o <path>`):** Write sanitized content to a file. 
* **Suppress Summary (`--no-redaction-summary`):** Suppress the display of the redaction summary at the end of the output. 
* **Enable Specific Rules (`--enable-rules <names>`):** Explicitly activate opt-in redaction rules by name (comma-separated). 
* **Disable Specific Rules (`--disable-rules <names>`):** Explicitly deactivate any redaction rules by name (comma-separated), overriding defaults or custom enabled rules. 
* **Select Rule Set (`--rules <name>`):** Apply a predefined rule configuration (e.g., `default` for standard non-opt-in rules, `strict` to enable all rules including opt-in ones). 
* **Statistics Mode (`--stats-only`):** Analyze input for sensitive data and provide a summary without performing redaction. 
* **Export Stats to JSON File (`--stats-json-file <path>`):** When in statistics mode, write the detailed redaction summary to a JSON file. 
* **Export Stats to Stdout (`--export-json-to-stdout`):** When in statistics mode, print the JSON summary directly to `stdout`, suppressing other output. 
* **Sample Matches in Stats (`--sample-matches <count>`):** Include a specified number of unique original match examples for each rule in JSON statistics. 
* **Fail on Threshold (`--fail-over-threshold <count>`):** In statistics mode, exit with an error code if the total number of detections exceeds this count. 
* **Debug Logging (`--debug`):** Enable verbose debug output for troubleshooting. 
* **Suppress Debugging (`--no-debug`):** Disable debug logging. 
* **Quiet Output (`--quiet`):** Suppress all warnings and informational messages, showing only errors.

````

## 5\. Known Issues

### 5.1. Custom‑Rule Overrides

  * **Severity:** Low — Broad “generic token” rules can potentially override more specific custom placeholders if not carefully defined.
  * **Workaround:** Make your custom patterns more precise or use the `--disable-rules` flag to control which rules are active.

-----

## 6\. Configuration Strategy

### 6.1. Custom Rules (`--config`)

You can define your own custom redaction rules in a YAML file and merge them with Cleansh's built-in defaults:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: emp_id
    pattern: 'EMP-\d{5}'
    replace_with: '[EMPLOYEE_ID_REDACTED]'
    multiline: false
    dot_matches_new_line: false
```

### 6.2. Rule Enable/Disable (`--enable-rules`, `--disable-rules`)

You can activate `opt_in` rules or deactivate any rule by name using CLI flags:

```bash
cleansh --enable-rules "uk_nino,aws_secret_key"
cleansh --disable-rules "email,ipv4_address"
```

-----

## 7\. Clipboard Support

  * **macOS & Windows:** Built‑in.
  * **Linux:** Requires `xclip`, `xsel` or `wl-clipboard`.

| **ANSI Stripping** | **Input content is pre-sanitized of escape codes to prevent evasion** |
| **Programmatic Validation** | **Numerical PII rules have built-in validation for added accuracy and security** |

-----

## 9\. Future Vision & Roadmap

Cleansh is charting a course toward adaptive, user-driven enhancements, transforming it into an intelligent, trainable security assistant. Planned areas of exploration include:

  * **Interactive Feedback Loop:** Enable users to provide feedback on specific matches (e.g., redact, ignore once, always ignore), allowing the tool to refine future detections.
  * **Heuristic Tuning:** Adjustable detection thresholds (entropy levels, pattern sensitivity) for fine-grained control over candidate selection.
  * **Enhanced CI/CD Modes:** Non-interactive audit outputs (JSON/exit codes) for automated pipelines, plus optional machine-readable reports.
  * **Ecosystem Extensions:** Additional integrations (e.g., pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI templates) and a WASM core for broader compatibility.
  * **Marketplace Concepts:** Explore the potential for a curated repository of community-maintained rule sets.
  * **Enterprise Features:** Namespaced rule collections, role-based workflows, and centralized policy management.

These explorations will inform future releases, helping us build the most robust, flexible, and trustworthy sanitization tool for developers and organizations.
