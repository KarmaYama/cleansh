## 1. Overview

`cleansh` is a powerful and reliable command‑line utility designed to help you quickly and securely redact sensitive information from your terminal output.
Whether you're debugging, collaborating, or sharing logs, `cleansh` ensures that confidential data like IP addresses, email addresses, and access tokens never leave your local environment unmasked. Piped directly from `stdin` or loaded from files, `cleansh` provides a robust, pre‑configured solution for data sanitization, with flexible options for custom rules and output formats.

**Sanitize your terminal output. One tool. One purpose.**

---

## 2. Important Note on Licensing

As part of `cleansh`'s commitment to sustainable development and continued innovation, we are shifting our licensing model starting with `v0.1.5`.

| Aspect | Versions (`< v0.1.5`) | Versions (`v0.1.5` and beyond, pre-v1.0) |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary License** | **MIT License** | **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0** |
| **Noncommercial Use** | Free to use | **Free to use** (for personal, academic, research, etc.) |
| **Commercial Use** | Free to use | **Requires a separate commercial license** |
| **Previous Versions** | Remain permanently MIT licensed | N/A (new license applies from `v0.1.5` onwards) |

---

"Commercial Use" includes, but is not limited to, any use of Cleansh:
* By for-profit entities or organizations.
* In a production environment for a commercial product or service.
* Where the use of Cleansh directly or indirectly contributes to commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
* By government agencies, unless explicitly covered by a separate agreement.

### 2.2. Cleansh v0.1.5: Evaluation & Trial Period

**Cleansh version 0.1.5 (current release) includes "Pro Features" that are typically intended for commercial applications.**
* While the core distribution remains under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0, we understand that commercial entities may wish to evaluate these features.
* For version 0.1.5 only, commercial users may **use Cleansh for evaluation and trial purposes without immediate legal action** from Cleansh maintainers.
* This evaluation period is intended to allow commercial users to assess Cleansh's suitability for their needs.

### 2.3. Future Enforcement: Cleansh v0.1.7 and Beyond

**Effective with the release of Cleansh version 0.1.7 (expected in Q4 2025), commercial use of Cleansh, including its "Pro Features," will strictly require a valid commercial license.**

* From v0.1.7 onwards, the Cleansh application will incorporate an **in-app license key validation mechanism**.

## 3. Core Capabilities – Current Version (**v0.1.5**)

This release represents a significant leap forward in `cleansh`'s accuracy, security, and testability. Based on our rigorously passing test suite, `cleansh` accurately masks:

### 3.1. Enhanced Redaction Categories:

`cleansh` offers broad and precise detection across a wide range of sensitive data types, complemented by robust programmatic validation for key PII:

* **Emails:** Common email formats (e.g., `user@example.com`).
* **IP Addresses:** Both **IPv4** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) and **IPv6** addresses (full uncompressed form, e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
* **Tokens & Secrets:**
    * **JWTs**
    * **GitHub PATs** (`ghp_…`)
    * **GitHub fine‑grained PATs** (`github_pat_…`, 72 characters)
    * **Stripe keys** (`sk_live_…`, `sk_test_…`, `rk_live_…`)
    * **AWS Access/Secret Keys**
    * **GCP API Keys**
    * **Google OAuth tokens** (`ya29.…`, 20–120 characters)
    * **SSH private keys**
    * **Generic Hex Secrets** (32 and 64 characters)
    * **Generic Tokens**
* **Personal Identifiable Information (PII):**
    * **Credit Card Numbers**
    * **US Social Security Numbers (SSN)** (with programmatic validation against invalid patterns like `000-XX-XXXX`, `666-XX-XXXX`, or `9XX-XX-XXXX`).
    * **UK National Insurance Numbers (NINO)** (with programmatic validation against invalid prefixes and structural rules).
    * **South African ID Numbers**
* **Paths & URLs:**
    * **Linux/macOS Absolute Paths** (`/home/user/...` → `~/home/user/...`).
    * **Windows Absolute Paths** (`C:\Users\…`, `\\Server\Share\…`).
    * **Slack Webhook URLs** (`https://hooks.slack.com/services/T...`)
* **Authentication Headers:**
    * **HTTP Basic Auth Headers** (`Authorization: Basic ...`)

### 3.2. Advanced Features (with flags):

`cleansh` provides command‑line flags to customize its behavior, all thoroughly tested:

* **Copy to Clipboard (`-c` / `--clipboard`):** Instantly copy sanitized output.
* **Diff View (`-d` / `--diff`):** Show a colored, line‑by‑line diff of redactions.
* **Custom Config (`--config <path>`):** Load and merge your YAML redaction rules with built-in defaults.
* **Output File (`-o <path>`):** Write sanitized content to a file.
* **Suppress Summary (`--no-redaction-summary`):** Suppress the display of the redaction summary at the end of the output.
* **Enable Specific Rules (`--enable-rules <names>`):** Explicitly activate opt-in redaction rules by name (comma-separated).
* **Disable Specific Rules (`--disable-rules <names>`):** Explicitly deactivate any redaction rules by name (comma-separated), overriding defaults or custom enabled rules.
* **Select Rule Set (`--rules <name>`):** Apply a predefined rule configuration (e.g., `default` for standard non-opt-in rules, `strict` to enable all rules including opt-in ones).
* **Statistics Mode (`--stats-only`):** Analyze input for sensitive data and provide a summary without performing redaction.
* **Export Stats to JSON File (`--stats-json-file <path>`):** When in statistics mode, write the detailed redaction summary to a JSON file.
* **Export Stats to Stdout (`--export-json-to-stdout`):** When in statistics mode, print the JSON summary directly to `stdout`, suppressing other output.
* **Sample Matches in Stats (`--sample-matches <count>`):** Include a specified number of unique original match examples for each rule in JSON statistics.
* **Fail on Threshold (`--fail-over-threshold <count>`):** In statistics mode, exit with an error code if the total number of detections exceeds this count.
* **Debug Logging (`--debug`):** Enable verbose debug output for troubleshooting.
* **Suppress Debugging (`--no-debug`):** Disable debug logging.
* **Quiet Output (`--quiet`):** Suppress all warnings and informational messages, showing only errors.

## 5\. Known Issues

### 5.1. Custom‑Rule Overrides

  * **Severity:** Low — Broad “generic token” rules can potentially override more specific custom placeholders if not carefully defined.
  * **Workaround:** Make your custom patterns more precise or use the `--disable-rules` flag to control which rules are active.

-----

## 6\. Configuration Strategy

### 6.1. Custom Rules (`--config`)

You can define your own custom redaction rules in a YAML file and merge them with Cleansh's built-in defaults:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: emp_id
    pattern: 'EMP-\d{5}'
    replace_with: '[EMPLOYEE_ID_REDACTED]'
    multiline: false
    dot_matches_new_line: false
```

### 6.2. Rule Enable/Disable (`--enable-rules`, `--disable-rules`)

You can activate `opt_in` rules or deactivate any rule by name using CLI flags:

```bash
cleansh --enable-rules "uk_nino,aws_secret_key"
cleansh --disable-rules "email,ipv4_address"
```

-----

## 7\. Clipboard Support

  * **macOS & Windows:** Built‑in.
  * **Linux:** Requires `xclip`, `xsel` or `wl-clipboard`.

-----

## 8\. Security by Default Principles

| Feature | Principle |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No runtime eval | All redaction via static regex, no code execution |
| Local‑only | No network calls or telemetry |
| Immutable defaults | Built‑in rules embedded at compile time |
| Path redaction | Filesystem paths normalized to `~` or Windows equivalents |
| YAML sandboxed | Declarative custom rules only, no arbitrary code execution |
| Clipboard opt‑in | `-c` flag explicitly required for clipboard copy |
| **ANSI Stripping** | **Input content is pre-sanitized of escape codes to prevent evasion** |
| **Programmatic Validation** | **Numerical PII rules have built-in validation for added accuracy and security** |

-----

## 9\. Future Vision & Roadmap

Cleansh is charting a course toward adaptive, user-driven enhancements, transforming it into an intelligent, trainable security assistant. Planned areas of exploration include:

  * **Interactive Feedback Loop:** Enable users to provide feedback on specific matches (e.g., redact, ignore once, always ignore), allowing the tool to refine future detections.
  * **Heuristic Tuning:** Adjustable detection thresholds (entropy levels, pattern sensitivity) for fine-grained control over candidate selection.
  * **Enhanced CI/CD Modes:** Non-interactive audit outputs (JSON/exit codes) for automated pipelines, plus optional machine-readable reports.
  * **Ecosystem Extensions:** Additional integrations (e.g., pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI templates) and a WASM core for broader compatibility.
  * **Marketplace Concepts:** Explore the potential for a curated repository of community-maintained rule sets.
  * **Enterprise Features:** Namespaced rule collections, role-based workflows, and centralized policy management.

These explorations will inform future releases, helping us build the most robust, flexible, and trustworthy sanitization tool for developers and organizations.
