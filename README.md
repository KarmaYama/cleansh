## Overview

This repository (`cleansh-workspace`) is a **Rust monorepo** designed for the secure sanitization of terminal output. It houses a growing ecosystem of tools and libraries under a unified development environment, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

* **license Notes Changes And Updates:** 

Please check our  [`License Notes`](./cleansh/LICENSE_NOTES.md) for more information.

The primary components currently include:

1.  **`cleansh` (CLI Application):** A high-trust, single-purpose command-line interface tool for redacting sensitive information from terminal output. This is the main user-facing application.
    * **Location:** [`/cleansh`](./cleansh/README.md)
    * **Purpose:** Provides a robust, pre-configured solution for data sanitization with flexible options for custom rules and output formats via the CLI.

2.  **`cleansh-core` (Core Library):** A standalone, reusable Rust library that encapsulates all the fundamental logic for data redaction, configuration management, and sensitive data validation.
    * **Location:** [`/cleansh-core`](./cleansh-core/README.md)
    * **Purpose:** Designed to be highly reliable and independent, enabling its potential future integration into other Rust projects and separate distribution on `crates.io`. The `cleansh` CLI seamlessly integrates with and utilizes this core library.
