**Stop relying on leaky regex. CleanSH (Clean Shell) is a high-trust, modular Rust utility designed to securely and programmatically sanitize sensitive data from your terminal output, logs, and text. Star this repo to follow our journey!**

---

## Overview

This repository (`cleansh-workspace`) is a **Rust monorepo** designed for the secure sanitization of terminal output. It houses a growing ecosystem of tools and libraries under a unified development environment, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

---

### Key Components

1.  **`CleanSH` (CLI Application):** A command-line utility for redacting sensitive information. This is the main user-facing application, built for high-trust and reliability.
    * **Location:** [`/cleansh`](./cleansh/README.md)
    * **Purpose:** Provides a pre-configured solution for data sanitization with flexible options for custom rules and output formats via the CLI.

2.  **`CleanSH-core` (Core Library):** A standalone, reusable Rust library that encapsulates the fundamental logic for data redaction and validation.
    * **Location:** [`/cleansh-core`](./cleansh-core/README.md)
    * **Purpose:** Designed to be highly reliable and independent, enabling seamless integration into other Rust projects. The `cleansh` CLI uses this core library.

---

### Licensing and Commercial Use

As part of our commitment to sustainable development, the `cleansh` project has adopted the **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0**.

* The **free tier** includes all core sanitization functionality, such as `cleansh sanitize`, and is available for all noncommercial uses.
* The **pro tier** includes advanced features designed for commercial and enterprise workflows, such as `cleansh scan`, which are now gated and require a commercial license key.

For a detailed breakdown of which features are in each tier and a full explanation of the licensing policy, please refer to the main `CleanSH` CLI [README](./cleansh/README.md) and [License Notes](./cleansh/LICENSE_NOTES.md).

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/KarmaYama/cleansh-workspace.git](https://github.com/KarmaYama/cleansh-workspace.git)
    cd cleansh-workspace
    ```

2.  **Build the Workspace:**
    The project is a Rust workspace, so you can build all components from the root:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3.  **Run Tests:**
    Ensure everything is functioning correctly by running the full test suite:
    ```bash
