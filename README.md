## ‚ú® Overview

`cleansh` is a powerful and reliable command-line utility designed to help you quickly and securely redact sensitive information from your terminal output. Whether you're debugging, collaborating, or sharing logs, `cleansh` ensures that confidential data like IP addresses, email addresses, and access tokens never leave your local environment unmasked. Piped directly from `stdin` or loaded from files, `cleansh` provides a robust, pre-configured solution for data sanitization, with flexible options for custom rules and output formats.

> **Sanitize your terminal output. One tool. One purpose.**

---

## ‚úÖ Core Capabilities ‚Äì Current Version (**v0.1.2**) - Stability & Output Refinement

This version of `cleansh` focuses on providing essential sanitization features with a strong emphasis on security and ease of use, building upon the "Precision View" of `v0.1.1`. Based on our rigorously passing test suite, you can trust `cleansh` to accurately mask the following sensitive data types and handle output reliably:

### üéØ Primary Redaction Categories:

* **Emails:** Common email address formats (e.g., `user@example.com`).
* **IP Addresses:** Both IPv4 addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
* **Tokens & Secrets:** Generic tokens, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), AWS keys, GCP keys, SSH keys, and common hex secrets.
* **Absolute Paths:** Currently, `cleansh` redacts Linux paths (e.g., `/home/user/documents/report.pdf` are transformed to `~/home/user/...`) and macOS paths (e.g., `/Users/admin/logs/app.log` are transformed to `~/Users/admin/...`).

### üí° Optional Features (with flags):

`cleansh` provides command-line flags to customize its behavior, all thoroughly tested:

* **Copy to Clipboard:** Use `--clipboard` (`-c`) to automatically copy the sanitized output to your system's clipboard.
* **Show Diff View:** Use `--diff` (`-d`) to display a clear, **line-by-line colored diff** between the original and sanitized content, highlighting all redactions, powered by the `diffy` crate.
* **Load Custom Config:** Use `--config <path/to/config.yaml>` to apply your own custom redaction rules, which can augment or override the powerful built-in defaults.
* **Output to File:** Use `--out <path/to/result.txt>` to write the sanitized output directly to a specified file.

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Sanitization (Piping from `stdin`)

```powershell
echo "My email is test@example.com and my IP is 192.168.1.1." | cleansh
````

### Cleaning `docker logs` before sharing

```bash
docker logs my-sensitive-container | cleansh
```

### Sanitizing `kubectl logs` output

```bash
kubectl logs my-pod-with-secrets | cleansh
```

### Copying to Clipboard (`-c` or `--clipboard`)

```bash
git config --list | cleansh -c
```

### Showing a Diff View (`-d` or `--diff`)

```bash
cat /var/log/app/errors.log | cleansh -d
```

### Loading Custom Redaction Rules (`--config <path>`)

```bash
cat my_sensitive_data.txt | cleansh --config ./custom_rules.yaml
```

### Outputting to a File (`-o <path>`)

```bash
my-script-with-secrets.sh | cleansh -o safe_output.log
```

### Reading Input from a File

```bash
cleansh < raw_log_file.txt
```

### Combining Flags

```bash
my-command-output | cleansh -d -o sanitized_output.txt
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### 1. Windows Absolute Path Redaction

* **Severity:** Medium
* **Impact:** Windows paths like `C:\Users\Alex\...` are not currently redacted.
* **Workaround:** Use a custom YAML rule.

### 2. Partial Custom Rule Interaction

* **Severity:** Low
* **Impact:** Custom rules may be partially overridden by built-in generic token rules.
* **Workaround:** Make custom patterns highly specific to avoid overlap.

## ‚öô Configuration Strategy

### 1. Runtime Settings (from `.env`)

**Example:**

```dotenv
LOG_LEVEL=info
CLIPBOARD_ENABLED=true
DEFAULT_CONFIG=./config/default_rules.yaml
```

### 2. User Rule Configuration (via `--config`)

```yaml
rules:
  - name: my_company_id
    pattern: 'EMP-\d{5}'
    replace_with: '[EMPLOYEE_ID_REDACTED]'
    description: "Redacts company employee IDs."
    multiline: false
    dot_matches_new_line: false
```

---

## üìã Clipboard Support

**macOS & Windows:** Fully supported.
**Linux:** Requires `xclip`, `xsel`, or `wl-clipboard`.

---

## üß† Sanitizer Engine Design (in `src/tools/sanitize_shell.rs`)

### Internal Pipeline:

1. Input Acquisition
2. Path Normalization
3. Built-in Rule Application
4. User Rule Application
5. Output (stdout, file, clipboard, or diff view)

### Engine Architecture:

* `regex::RegexSet`
* `strip-ansi-escapes`
* Compile-time embedded rules

---

## üìä Logging and Error Handling

### Logging:

* Powered by `log` + `env_logger`
* Configurable via `.env` or `--debug`

### Error Handling:

* `anyhow` + `thiserror`
* Fail-safe, graceful recovery on non-blocking issues

---

## üß™ Testing and Validations

### Unit Tests:

* Regex Accuracy
* Path Redaction
* YAML Parsing

### Integration Tests:

* Stdin Piping
* Clipboard Mocks
* File Output
* Diff Accuracy
* No Redaction Grace Case

| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| No runtime eval    | Regex-only logic ‚Äî no execution of external inputs.      |
| Local-only         | No cloud or telemetry.                                   |
| Immutable defaults | Redaction rules are compiled in, not loaded dynamically. |
| Path redaction     | File system details are sanitized by default.            |
| YAML sandboxed     | Config is declarative only.                              |
| Clipboard opt-in   | Requires `-c` flag ‚Äî avoids silent clipboard actions.    |

## üõ† Future-Proofing (Post v1.0 Aspirations)

* Plugin system for redaction logic
* VS Code extension or web GUI
* WASM/browser version
* Git hook integration
