## Overview

This repository (`cleansh-workspace`) is a **Rust monorepo** designed for the secure sanitization of terminal output. It houses a growing ecosystem of tools and libraries under a unified development environment, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

---

### Key Components

1.  **`cleansh` (CLI Application):** A command-line utility for redacting sensitive information. This is the main user-facing application, built for high-trust and reliability.
    * **Location:** [`/cleansh`](./cleansh/README.md)
    * **Purpose:** Provides a pre-configured solution for data sanitization with flexible options for custom rules and output formats via the CLI.

2.  **`cleansh-core` (Core Library):** A standalone, reusable Rust library that encapsulates the fundamental logic for data redaction and validation.
    * **Location:** [`/cleansh-core`](./cleansh-core/README.md)
    * **Purpose:** Designed to be highly reliable and independent, enabling seamless integration into other Rust projects. The `cleansh` CLI uses this core library.
