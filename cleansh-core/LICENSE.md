## BUSINESS SOURCE LICENSE 1.1

* **Preamble**
    The Business Source License (BUSL) is a "Copyleft" license, like the GPL, in the sense that source code is available to all, and modifications and derivatives must also be made available. Unlike the GPL, however, it is not an Open Source license for a defined period of time. After that defined period of time (the "Change Date"), the Licensed Work automatically converts to an Open Source License. This means that after the Change Date, the Licensed Work can be used for any purpose, and the terms of this License no longer apply.

* **1. Definitions**
    "Licensed Work" means the source code for the cleansh-core library licensed under the terms of this License.
    "Licensor" means Cleansh Technologies.
    "Licensee" means anyone who receives the Licensed Work.
    "Change Date" is specified above.
    "Change License" is specified above.
    "Additional Use Grant" is specified above.

* **2. Grant of License**
    Licensor hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual (subject to the termination provisions in Section 4) license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Licensed Work, subject to the terms of this License.

* **3. Restrictions**
    Licensee may not use the Licensed Work for production purposes prior to the Change Date, except as expressly permitted by the Additional Use Grant. "Production purposes" means the deployment, operation, or provision of the Licensed Work or any derivative work thereof, directly or indirectly, for revenue-generating activities. For clarity, internal development and testing are permitted.

* **4. Termination**
    This License will terminate automatically if Licensee fails to comply with any of its terms and conditions. Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use of the Licensed Work and destroy all copies of the Licensed Work in its possession or control. Sections 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

* **5. Change Date**
    On the Change Date, the Licensed Work automatically converts to the Change License. All other terms of this License cease to apply on the Change Date.

* **6. Disclaimer of Warranty**
    THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSED WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE LICENSED WORK.

* **7. Limitation of Liability**
    IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE LICENSED WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

* **8. General**
    This License is governed by the laws of the Licensor's jurisdiction, excluding its conflict of laws principles. Any litigation arising out of or relating to this License shall be brought in the courts located in the Licensor's jurisdiction.
