//! Defines the core SanitizationEngine trait and related data structures.
//!
//! The `SanitizationEngine` trait provides a pluggable interface for different
//! sanitization methods (e.g., regex, entropy). This module defines the
//! contract that all such engines must adhere to, ensuring a consistent
//! and interchangeable core API for `cleansh`.
