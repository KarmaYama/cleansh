### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the [CleanSH repository](https://github.com/KarmaYama/cleansh-workspace/cleansh) to your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KarmYama/cleansh-workspace.git
    cd cleansh
    ```
3.  **Install Rust:** If you don't have Rust installed, follow the instructions on [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/). `CleanSH` uses the latest stable Rust version (currently `1.88.0` as per `Cargo.toml`).
4.  **Build and Test:**
    ```bash
    cargo build
    cargo test
    ```
    Ensure all tests pass before making changes.

### Making Changes

1.  **Create a New Branch:** Always work on a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name like `fix/windows-paths` or `feat/add-json-redaction`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-or-bugfix-branch
    ```
2.  **Code Style:** We follow standard Rust formatting. Please run `cargo fmt` before committing.
    ```bash
    cargo fmt
    ```
3.  **Tests:**
      * For bug fixes, add a test that reproduces the bug and then passes with your fix.
      * For new features, add comprehensive unit and integration tests covering the new functionality and edge cases. Refer to the `src/tests/` and the `Integration Tests` section in the `README.md` for examples.
4.  **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. A good commit message explains *what* was changed and *why*.
      * Use the present tense ("Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
      * Limit the first line to 72 characters.
      * Reference relevant issue numbers (e.g., `Fix #123`).

### Submitting Your Pull Request (PR)

1.  **Push Your Changes:** Push your local branch to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-feature-or-bugfix-branch
